<p>I directed myself down the path of Data Science purely because I viewed the ability to program and perform statistical analyses as tools that would supplement my interests. I view them as tools because the real art is in the creativity. Merging programming/statistics + creative mind = leverage. I am not referring to capital leverage, rather human leverage. Having things that work for you while you sleep and compound over time will grant you freedom.</p>
<p>Programming is a form of leverage. You essentially have a robot doing tasks for you that you would otherwise consider mundane or time consuming. Furthermore, statistics is leverage in the sense that you can apply previously known statistical knowledge on new material and automatically program more complex models that begin to make predictions or summaries for you. A very common form that people are infatuated by is the creative leverage Youtubers have. Most youtubers usually lose money in the beginning, but those who persist with meaningful content over time can create a form of leverage that “earns while they sleep”, and that, is true freedom.</p>
<p>This is only a glib representation of my thoughts regarding this framework for life, I can point you to sources I believe will meaningful expand your knowledge on this.</p>
